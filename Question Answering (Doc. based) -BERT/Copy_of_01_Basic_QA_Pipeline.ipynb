If you're looking for a Question Answering tutorial that uses a DocumentStore such as Elasticsearch, go to our new [Build a Scalable Question Answering System](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/03_scalable_qa_system) tutorial.\n",

        "- **Goal**: After completing this tutorial, you will have learned about the Reader and Retriever, and built a question answering pipeline that can answer questions about the Game of Thrones series.\n"

Your system will use Game of Thrones files and will be able to answer questions like \"Who is the father of Arya Stark?\". But you can use it to run on any other set of documents, such as your company's internal wikis or a collection of financial reports. \n",

For example, Document preparation and pipeline initialization are handled by ready-made classes that replace lines of initialization code. But don't worry!

In this tutorial, we're using the `InMemoryDocumentStore`, which is the simplest DocumentStore to get started with. It requires no external dependencies and it's a good option for smaller projects and debugging. But it doesn't scale up so well to larger Document collections, so it's not a good choice for production systems. To learn more about the DocumentStore and the different types of external databases that we support, see [DocumentStore](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store).\n",

Unlike traditional record keeping which consolidates records in a central location or ledger, blockchain uses a decentralized ledger which stores copies of records on multiple devices or nodes. Because all nodes must have the same version of the ledger, it is very difficult to retroactively change transaction records.

As blockchain gains more and more traction outside of the cryptocurrency arena, understanding the technology is becoming increasingly important. To help, the following is a glossary of key terms related to blockchain technology:\\n\\nBlockchain - Blockchain is a mathematical system of record keeping made up of blocks of transactional data which are linked in chronological order. Unlike traditional record keeping which consolidates records in a central location or ledger, blockchain uses a decentralized ledger which stores copies of records on multiple devices or nodes. Because all nodes must have the same version of the ledger, it is very difficult to retroactively change transaction records. The use of distributed ledgers and encryption make blockchain records very difficult to hack, forge or disrupt.\\n\\nBlock - A block is the basic container for storing transaction data within a blockchain.\\n\\nNode - A node is a computing device that is part of a blockchain network.
